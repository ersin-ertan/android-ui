About:

This in a rework of the Effective Android UI project, which uses Dagger 2 instead of Dagger 1. The goal is to better understand the intent, structure, and interactions of mvp and mvvm without the use of frameworks. I would consider this the precursor to googles data binding, and other MVP libraries like socekqwe's Mosby.

This project also uses native java and android concurrency concepts like executors, handlers, which I would consider it to be the precursor to working with RxJava/Android; which would cut down on the lines of code, error potential, conceptual requirements.
